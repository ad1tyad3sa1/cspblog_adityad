# Data Structures Seed requirements.

## Argument for 3.0 Seed

- **92% or better in class**

![Grade](https://files.catbox.moe/lspow0.png)

- **CPT project is deployed**

*Deployed and demonstrated on cockpit during finals review* 

- **Teacher markers are removed from your CPT project.  For instance, Frontend and Backend Home pages and navigation should be personalized.   Test data should be changed.   I would like backdoor accounts for toby:123toby and hop:123hop, but change their names and dob to match them of your project.**

*Changed username database into customized names below*

[Ideation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8uBaQVnT0_nZL8PzRJDSirL_9KprbfF9X-xD7-Vcrs/edit#heading=h.a62yyrdcn1j)

- **Personal copy of CPT project.  Make sure you have Frontend and Backend for CPT project ready for  additional work.  Since teams will be split up by registration... you should make team repos a template and everyone should make a personal copy (both frontend an backend)**

Personal Copies of Frontend/Backend Repos of CPT:
