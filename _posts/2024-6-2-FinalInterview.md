# Introduction of Full Stack Coding Skill Set and ML Experience

## Full Stack Coding Skill Set

Throughout the year in AP Computer Science Principles, I have developed a solid full stack coding skill set. On the backend, I have worked extensively with Python and Flask to create and manage API endpoints, handle server-side logic, and manage data using SQLite databases. On the frontend, I have become proficient in HTML and JavaScript, building dynamic web pages and user interfaces. I have also developed machine learning algorithms to generate optimal outputs based on user inputs. Additionally, I have learned to organize development using Agile methodology and effective planning strategies. This diverse skill set has equipped me to build complete web applications and understand various aspects of digital development. In addition my understanding of the internet and processes that occur on the web have improved. I've learned to be successful in deployment and other valuable development skills.

## Machine Learning (ML) Experience

I engaged in machine learning projects that applied various algorithms to address practical problems. One significant example involved creating a predictive model for Titanic survival using Python and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. By leveraging the Logistic Regression algorithm, we trained the model to estimate survival probabilities based on passenger attributes such as gender and age. Additionally, we developed an algorithm to predict bakery item orders using historical data stored in a CSV file. For these predictions, we utilized Linear Regression. After preprocessing data with Pandas, we employed the Decision Tree Classifier to predict the likelihood of specific bakery items being ordered at different times. This involved feature engineering, where factors like time, day type (weekday/weekend), and part of the day (morning/afternoon) were extracted and used as inputs. Using Scikit-Learn's libraries for model training and evaluation, we applied our understanding of algorithmic techniques, data manipulation, and predictive modeling. For my final project, we created our own "ml model" that used sorting algorithms to filter stock data to benefit users using the app. It required skills learned from previous projects like filtering/formatting data, initializing a payload, api endpoints, and fetch requests to work. Overall, these ML projects were crucial in enhancing my understanding of predictive algorithms and contributed significantly to my accomplishments as a Full Stack Developer. 

## Showcasing Projects:

**N@tM - Trimester 1**

- Presented “Passion Project” at N@tM with my group
- Exotic Car Renting Web Page
- Attracted a good amount of attention during our presentation time, with students and parents alike coming to see other try renting cars, experiencing our 3d blender car garage, and viewing car information.

**N@tM - Trimester 2**

- Presented “CPT Project” at N@tM with my group
- Contributed to group presentation by presenting my feature, demonstrating the coordination of leaderboard and point update that showed up after baking an item for each user
- More interesting project, attracted more people
- Improved presentation skills

**N@tM - Trimester 3** 

- Presented “Final Project” with my group
- Stocks sorting algorithms and UI that allowed people to buy stocks was well rehearsed and effectively displayed to those watching
- Made a greater impact on my audiences than before presentations

## Favorite Project Demo

My favorite project I would like to demo is my cooking game Let E'm Cook which I spent the most time and effort on perfecting and improving for the collegeboard CPT assessment. I made major improvements i=on the project throughout the year and it would be the best one to demo and show my ability as a full stack developer. Would like to implement a more practical ML model that would make the game more interesting. 

## Unique Qualification(s)

Throughout the year, I have demonstrated my abilities as both a programmer and student when organizing, planning, and executing group projects. Additionally, as a leader, I asked clarifying questions that benefit the group, outline teacher/group expectations, and managed workflow as the Scrum Master.

- Hard worker that perseveres through problems

- Strategic planner with good attention to detail

- Ability to foster collaboration, cooperation, and creativity within a team 

- Provide guidance, support, and motivation to rest of the team

My experience from this year was valuable in establishing myself as a group leader and programmer in a development setting. My interests lie in exploring machine learning models and AI. My learnings in full stack development and ML have helped me excel in this class and make me capable and worthy for a position in  Nighthawk Coders Content Creation internship under the ML Study Plan.
