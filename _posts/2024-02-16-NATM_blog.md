# Our Team

Our explanation of the technical details related to basic functionality of our features was excellent. We were able to explain our code to expert software engineers and ask for feedback about things we could improve.

## Grows:

- Organization, everyone was crowding around one person during demo.

- Instead we can allow more people to access, see, test, and give suggestions to our project by keeping it more open and on display.

## Glows:

- Explanation of my database and fetch of info was understandable

- Learned a lot about others teams projects and functionality

- Received great feedback from others

- Worked well each other to explain how each of our features related to one another

## Additions on CPT Project:

- Work on a easier to use UI so that instead of users having to scroll and find their ingredient they can simply search it up.

- Make icons more recognizable.

- Store already made recipes.

# Blogging on Event

- I was able to see a variety of projects that satisfied the CPT requirements in a variety of ways.

## Some Examples:

- Game that stored positions of enemy and user and correlated it to objects on the field.

![Investment Application](https://files.catbox.moe/9rm3xz.JPG)

- Investment application set up almost like a dating app where user can swipe through different companies and decide which ones they would like to invest in.

![Media](https://files.catbox.moe/m5uz2a.JPG)

- A made up social media platform that allows users to comment, like, and dislike posts by other users. 

![Videos](https://files.catbox.moe/vxe2hs.JPG)

- A platform that allows users to upload videos and share them. 

All of the things above I found impressive and was intrigued to figure out how they did it, playing around with the application and understanding the code helped me do that. 

## Other Things

I really enjoyed the collaborative process in which everyone explained their project and were eager to know about each others. The overall active atmosphere enabled my group and I to seek others to talk to and share our stuff with them. Also I motivated to learn stuff from other teams and how they planned and constructed their CPT projects.
