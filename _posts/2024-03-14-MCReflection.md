## Corrections


**Question 4**

![q4](https://files.catbox.moe/ghceyf.png)

- The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses protocols to connect devices worldwide. The World Wide Web is an information system (of pages, programs, and files) that is accessible over the Internet. Therefore, D is correct.

**Question 8**

![q8](https://files.catbox.moe/r48q69.png)

- If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible. This is supported by redundancy in the network. So choice C is the best option.

**Question 14**

![q14](https://files.catbox.moe/mek3n6.png)

- As is, the procedure traverses numberList from left to right and returns true whenever it encounters a value that is less than the preceding value. If it never encounters such a value, false is returned. This has the effect of returning true whenever the list is not increasing and returning false whenever the list is increasing, which is the opposite of what is intended. By interchanging lines 8 and 12, the procedure will return true or false appropriately. So choice C.

**Question 18**

![q18](https://files.catbox.moe/9721na.png)

- If devices B and F fail, then devices E, G, and H will become isolated from devices A, C, D, and I. Therefore, device A will be unable to communicate with device G. Therefore answer C works.

**Question 36**

![q36](https://files.catbox.moe/niozkn.png)

- Personal information can be found in a variety of places where authentication measures may not be used, including social media sites. Personal information placed online can be collected, aggregated, distributed, and exploited. D is best choice.

**Question 44**

![q44](https://files.catbox.moe/1yeajv.png)

- The fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers limits the range of these values; this limitation can result in round-off errors. Round-off errors typically result in imprecise values or results. Choice B is the best option.

**Question 45**

![q45](https://files.catbox.moe/prirp4.png)

- In this code segment, the first call to botStepper moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward two squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The code segment then moves the robot forward one square. The second call to botStepper moves the robot forward three squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward three squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The robot ends in the gray square. Therefore, choice C completes the task.
**Question 48**

![q48](https://files.catbox.moe/22j0qh.png)

- A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point. Correct answer A.

**Question 57**

![q57](https://files.catbox.moe/xkbae9.png)

- With two processors running in parallel, execution time is minimized when the processors take on as close to an equal workload as possible. Running processes P and Q on one processor will take a total of 40 seconds. Running processes R and S on the other processor will take a total of 35 seconds. As the processors run in parallel, all four operations are completed in 40 seconds. So, A is correct.
